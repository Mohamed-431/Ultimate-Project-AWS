# Ultimate-Project-AWS
Project Overview
I will be implementing a complete end-to-end DevOps implementation for a modern, cloud-native e-commerce application. It will cover everything from infrastructure provisioning using Terraform to application deployment on AWS EKS using Kubernetes. The project also includes containerization with Docker, CI/CD pipeline automation using GitHub Actions, and basic monitoring and maintenance practices. Designed to simulate a real-world DevOps workflow, this implementation follows industry best practices for scalability, security, and automation.
